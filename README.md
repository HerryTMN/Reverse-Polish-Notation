# REVERSE POLISH NOTATION CALCULATOR
HOW TO USE:
Unlike with a traditional calculator, you enter the parameters first, then the operator.

For example, to calculate '20+50': type '20' -> Press Enter -> '50' -> Press '+'

The 'CE' button means CANCEL ENTRY deletes the input line.

The 'C' button means CLEAR - deletes the whole stack.

The 'SWAP' button  to swap the last two elements.
